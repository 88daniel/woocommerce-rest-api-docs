# Introduction #

WooCommerce 2.6+ is fully integrated with the WordPress [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) API. This allows WooCommerce data to be created, read, updated, and deleted using requests in JSON format, and using WordPress REST API Authentication methods, and standard HTTP verbs, which are understood by most HTTP clients.

The current WP REST API integration version is `v1` which takes a first-order position in endpoints. The following table shows API versions present in each major version of WooCommerce:

| Version | WooCommerce Version | WordPress Version    |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `v1`    | 2.6.x               | 4.4 or later         |

## Requirements ##

To use the latest version of the REST API you must be using:

* WooCommerce 2.6+
* WordPress 4.4+
* Pretty permalinks in `Settings > Permalinks` so that the custom endpoints are supported. __Default permalinks will not work.__
* You may access the API over either HTTP or HTTPS, but *HTTPS is recommended where possible*.

If you use ModSecurity and see `501 Method Not Implemented` errors, see [this issue](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/9838) for details.

## Legacy API ##

Prior to 2.6, WooCommerce had it's own REST API independent from WordPress. The differences between the new API and legacy API are as follows:

* In the new API, the WordPress REST API handles authentication instead of our API.
* The WP REST API integration includes batch endpoints for coupons, customers, orders, refunds, products, attributes, categories, tags, taxes and webhooks.
* New formats and parameters for coupons, orders, products and some taxomonies to reflect changes in the WooCommerce core.
* We've adopted the use of schemas for all endpoints (accessed when doing OPTIONS requests).

Our API Keys, authentication endpoint and webhooks still work with the new API.

Documentation for the legacy APIs can be found below:

* [WooCommerce REST API v1 docs](v1.html)
* [WooCommerce REST API v2 docs](v2.html)
* [WooCommerce REST API v3 docs](v3.html)

## Request/Response Format ##

The default response format is JSON. Requests with a message-body use plain JSON to set or update resource attributes. Successful requests will return a `200 OK` HTTP status.

Some general information about responses:

* Dates are returned in [RFC3339](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format in UTC timezone: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
* Resource IDs are returned as integers.
* Any decimal monetary amount, such as prices or totals, will be returned as strings with two decimal places. The decimal separator (typically either `.` or `,`) is controlled by the site and is included in the API index. This is by design in order to make localization of API data easier for the client. You may need to account for this in your implementation if you will be doing calculations with the returned data (e.g. converting string amounts with commas to decimal places before performing calculations).
* Other amounts, such as item counts, are returned as integers.
* Blank fields are generally included as `null` instead of being returned as blank strings or omitted.

### JSONP Support ###

@TODO

The API supports JSONP by default. JSONP responses use the `application/javascript` content-type. You can specify the callback using the `?_jsonp` parameter for `GET` requests to have the response wrapped in a JSON function:

<div class="api-endpoint">
	<div class="endpoint-data">
		<i class="label label-get">GET</i>
		<h6>/wc-api/v3/orders/count?_jsonp=ordersCount</h6>
	</div>
</div>

```shell
curl https://example.com/wc-api/v3/orders/count?_jsonp=ordersCount \
	-u consumer_key:consumer_secret
```

> Response:

```
\**\ordersCount({"count":8})
```

> If the site administrator has chosen to disable it, you will receive a `400 Bad Request` error:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "woocommerce_api_jsonp_disabled",
      "message": "JSONP support is disabled on this site"
    }
  ]
}
```

> If your callback contains invalid characters, you will receive a `400 Bad Request` error:


```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "woocommerce_api_jsonp_callback_invalid",
      "message": "The JSONP callback function is invalid"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Errors ##

@TODO

Occasionally you might encounter errors when accessing the API. There are four possible types:

* Invalid requests, such as using an unsupported HTTP method will result in `400 Bad Request`.
* Authentication or permission errors, such as incorrect API keys will result in `401 Unauthorized`.
* Requests to resources that don't exist or are missing required parameters will result in `404 Not Found`.
* Requests that cannot be processed due to a server error will result in `500 Internal Server Error`.

> `400 Bad Request` example:

```json
{
  "errors" : [
    {
      "code" : "woocommerce_api_unsupported_method",
      "message" : "Unsupported request method"
    }
  ]
}
```

> `401 Unauthorized` example:

```json
{
  "errors" : [
    {
      "code" : "woocommerce_api_authentication_error",
      "message" : "Consumer Key is invalid"
    }
  ]
}
```

> `404 Not Found` example:

```json
{
  "errors" : [
    {
      "code" : "woocommerce_api_invalid_order",
      "message" : "Invalid order"
    }
  ]
}
```

> `500 Internal Server Error` example:

```json
{
  "errors" : [
    {
      "code" : "woocommerce_api_invalid_handler",
      "message" : "The handler for the route is invalid"
    }
  ]
}
```

Errors return both an appropriate HTTP status code and response object which contains a `code` and `message` attribute. If an endpoint has any custom errors, they are documented within that endpoint.

## Parameters ##

@TODO

All endpoints accept optional parameters which can be passed as a HTTP query string parameter, e.g. `GET /orders?status=completed`. There are common parameters and endpoint-specific parameters which are documented along with that endpoint.

### Filter Parameter ###

All endpoints accept a `filter` parameter that scopes individual filters using brackets, like date filtering:

`GET /orders?filter[created_at_min]=2013-11-01`

Multiple `filter` parameters can be included and intermixed with other parameters:

`GET /orders?status=completed&filter[created_at_min]=2013-11-01&filter[created_at_max]=2013-11-30`

Note that the following filters are supported for all endpoints except the `reports` endpoint, which has it's own set of filters that are documented along with that endpoint.

#### Available Filters ####

|       Filter       |                                                                                                                                         Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `created_at_min`   | given a date, only resources *created after the provided date* will be returned                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `created_at_max`   | given a date, only resources *created before the provided date* will be returned                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `updated_at_min`   | given a date, only resources *updated after the provided date* will be returned                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `updated_at_max`   | given a date, only resources *updated before the provided date* will be returned                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `q`                | performs a keyword search and returns resources that match, e.g. `GET /products?filter[q]=search-keyword`. Note that search terms should be URL-encoded as they will be decoded internally with [`urldecode`](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.urldecode.php)                           |
| `order`            | controls the ordering of the resources returned, accepted values are `ASC` (default) or `DESC`                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `orderby`          | controls the field that is used for ordering the resources returned. Accepts the same arguments as [`WP_Query`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters). Defaults to `date`. You can order by `meta_value` but you must provide `orderby_meta_key` |
| `orderby_meta_key` | the meta key to order returned resources by when using `orderby=meta_value`. For example, you could order products by price using `GET /products?filter[orderby]=meta_value_num&filter[orderby_meta_key]=_price`                                                                             |
| `post_status`      | limits resources to only those with the specified post status. Most useful for returning unpublished products, e.g. `GET /products?filter[post_status]=draft`                                                                                                                                |
| `meta`             | resource meta is excluded by default, but it can be included by setting `meta=true`, e.g. `GET /orders?filter[meta]=true`. Protected meta (meta whose key is prefixed with an underscore) is not included in the response                                                                    |
| `pagination`       | explained below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note that Dates should be provided in [RFC3339](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format in the UTC timezone: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. You may omit the time and timezone if desired.

### Fields Parameter ###

You may limit the fields returned in the response using the `fields` parameter:

`GET /orders?fields=id`

To include multiple fields, separate them with commas:

`GET /orders?fields=id,status`

You can specify sub-fields using dot-notation:

`GET /orders?fields=id,status,payment_details.method_title`

Sub-fields can't be limited for resources that have multiple structs, like an order's line items. For example, this will return just the line items, but each line item will have the full set of information, not just the product ID:

`GET /orders?fields=line_items.product_id`

## Pagination ##

@TODO

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 10 items by default. This default can be changed by the site administrator by changing the `posts_per_page` option. Alternatively the items per page can be specified with the `?filter[limit]` parameter:

`GET /orders?filter[limit]=15`

You can specify further pages with the `?page` parameter:

`GET /orders?page=2`

You may also specify the offset from the first resource using the `?filter[offset]` parameter:

`GET /orders?filter[offset]=5`

Page number is 1-based and omitting the `?page` parameter will return the first page.

The total number of resources and pages are always included in the `X-WC-Total` and `X-WC-TotalPages` HTTP headers.

### Link Header ###

@TODO

Pagination info is included in the [Link Header](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). It's recommended that you follow these values instead of building your own URLs where possible.

```
Link: <https://www.example.com/wc-api/v1/products?page=2>; rel="next",
<https://www.example.com/wc-api/v1/products?page=3>; rel="last"`
```

*Linebreak included for readability*

The possible `rel` values are:

|  Value  |                       Description                       |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `next`  | Shows the URL of the immediate next page of results     |
| `last`  | Shows the URL of the last page of results               |
| `first` | Shows the URL of the first page of results              |
| `prev`  | Shows the URL of the immediate previous page of results |

Some useful tools you can use to access the API include:

* [CocoaRestClient](http://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/) - A free, easy to use Mac OS X GUI client for interacting with the API, most useful when your test store has SSL enabled.
* [Paw HTTP Client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paw-http-client/id584653203?mt=12) - Another excellent HTTP client for Mac OS X.
* [RESTClient, a debugger for RESTful web services](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/) - Free Firefox add-on.
* [Advanced REST client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo) - Free Google Chrome extension.

# Authentication #

@TODO

There are two ways to authenticate with the API, depending on whether the site supports SSL.  Remember that the Index endpoint will indicate if the site supports SSL.

### Over HTTPS ###

You may use [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) by providing the API Consumer Key as the username and the API Consumer Secret as the password.

> HTTP Basic Auth example

```shell
curl https://www.example.com/wc-api/v3/orders \
    -u consumer_key:consumer_secret
```

Occasionally some servers may not parse the Authorization header correctly (if you see a "Consumer key is missing" error when authenticating over SSL, you have a server issue). In this case, you may provide the consumer key/secret as query string parameters.

> Example for servers that not properly parse the Authorization header:

```shell
curl https://www.example.com/wc-api/v3/orders?consumer_key=123&consumer_secret=abc
```

### Over HTTP ###

You must use [OAuth 1.0a "one-legged" authentication](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) to ensure API credentials cannot be intercepted. Typically you will use any standard OAuth 1.0a library in the language of choice to handle the authentication, or generate the necessary parameters by following the following instructions.

#### Generating an OAuth signature ####

1) Set the HTTP method for the request:

`GET`

2) Set your base request URI -- this is the full request URI without query string parameters -- and URL encode according to RFC 3986:

`http://www.example.com/wc-api/v1/orders`

when encoded:

`http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fwc-api%2Fv1%2Forders`

3) Collect and normalize your query string parameters. This includes all `oauth_*` parameters except for the signature. Parameters should be normalized by URL encoding according to RFC 3986 (`rawurlencode` in PHP) and percent(`%`) characters should be double-encoded (e.g. `%` becomes `%25`.

4) Sort the parameters in byte-order (`uksort( $params, 'strcmp' )` in PHP)

5) Join each parameter with an encoded equals sign (`%3D`):

`oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1`

6) Join each parameter key/value with an encoded ampersand (`%26`):

`oauth_consumer_key%3Dabc123%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1`

7) Form the string to sign by joining the HTTP method, encoded base request URI, and encoded parameter string with an unencoded ampersand symbol (&):

`GET&http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fwc-api%2Fv1%2Forders&oauth_consumer_key%3Dabc123%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1`

8) Generate the signature using the string to key and your consumer secret key

If you are having trouble generating a correct signature, you'll want to review the string you are signing for encoding errors. The [authentication source](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/blob/master/includes/api/class-wc-api-authentication.php#L177) can also be helpful in understanding how to properly generate the signature.

#### OAuth Tips ####

* The OAuth parameters must be added as query string parameters and *not* included in the Authorization header. This is because there is no reliable cross-platform way to get the raw request headers in WordPress.
* The require parameters are: `oauth_consumer_key`, `oauth_timestamp`, `oauth_nonce`, `oauth_signature`, and `oauth_signature_method`. `oauth_version` is not required and should be omitted.
* HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256 are the only accepted hash algorithms.
* The OAuth nonce can be any randomly generated 32 character (recommended) string that is unique to the consumer key. Read more suggestions on [generating nonces on the Twitter API forums](https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/12445).
* The OAuth timestamp should be the unix timestamp at the time of the request. The API will deny any requests that include a timestamp outside of a 15 minute window to prevent replay attacks.
* You must use the store URL provided by the index when forming the base string used for the signature, as this is what the server will use. (e.g. if the store URL includes a `www` sub-domain, you should use it for requests)
* You may test your generated signature using LinkedIn's [OAuth test console](http://developer.linkedinlabs.com/oauth-test/) -- leave the member token/secret blank.
* Twitter has great instructions on [generating signatures](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/creating-signature) with OAuth 1.0a, but remember tokens are not used with this implementation.
* Note that the request body is *not* signed as per the OAuth spec, see [Google's OAuth 1.0 extension](https://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ext/body_hash/1.0/oauth-bodyhash.html) for details on why.
* If including filter fields in your request, it saves a lot of trouble if you can order your filter fields alphabetically before submitting. Many Oauth libraries won't order subquery fields properly, resulting in invalid signatures.
